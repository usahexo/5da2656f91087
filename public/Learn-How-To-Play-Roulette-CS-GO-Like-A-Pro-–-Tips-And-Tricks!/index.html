<p>An inside bet is a bet placed on one or more specific numbers on the roulette table layout, whereas an outside bet is a bet placed on a group of numbers, including colors (red or black), whether the number is odd or even, or which range the number falls within (1-18 or 19-36).</p>
<p>Before we get started with the tips and tricks, let’s take a closer look at the different types of inside bets you can make in roulette CS: GO.</p>
<p>Straight Up Bet</p>
<p>A straight up bet is a bet placed on any one specific number on the table layout. The chips are placed on the square of the number you wish to bet on. If that number is hit, then you win 35 to 1 odds. However, if zero hits, then you lose your entire bet amount.</p>
<p>Split Bet</p>
<p>A split bet is similar to a straight up bet, but instead of betting on just one number, you are betting on two numbers that are adjacent to each other on the table layout. To place a split bet, simply place your chips onto the line between two numbers. Your winning payout will be 17 to 1 if either number hits. If both numbers hit, then you will receive 34 to 1 odds. Like with a straight up bet, if zero hits then you lose your entire stake amount.</p>
<p>Street Bet</p>
<p>A street bet is when you wager on three consecutive numbers that fall horizontally on the table layout. To make this type of wager, place your chips at the end of any row of three numbers. If any one of these three numbers comes up when the ball lands in the wheel, then you will win 11 to 1 odds. All three numbers hitting results in a street bet payout of 33 to 1 odds. If zero comes up though, then you lose your total stake amount wagered.</p>

Roulette can be played online or in a real casino, and it is one of the most popular casino games.</p>
<p>There are a few things you can do to increase your chances of winning when playing roulette. Here are five easy tips for winning more money at roulette:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Choose a European wheel instead of an American wheel. The American wheel has 38 pockets, while the European wheel has only 36 pockets. This means that the odds are slightly in favor of the player when playing on a European wheel.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Bet on black or red instead of odd or even. The odds are again in favor of the player when betting on black or red, as there is a 50% chance of winning each bet. Odds are not as good when betting on even or odd, as these bets have just a 47.37% chance of winning.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Bet on high numbers (19-36) instead of low numbers (1-18). The odds are slightly lower when betting on high numbers, but they are still in favor of the player. Low numbers have just a 16.22% chance of winning, while high numbers have a 20.51% chance of winning.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Try to avoid betting on single numbers – the odds are very low (2.63%). It is better to spread your bets out across several different numbers instead of betting on just one number.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use outside bets rather than inside bets. Outside bets have better odds than inside bets, so they are a better option if you want to increase your chances of winning money at roulette CS: GO .</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="Precisely-How-To-Play-Roulette-In-Counter-Strike-Global-Offensive"><a href="#Precisely-How-To-Play-Roulette-In-Counter-Strike-Global-Offensive" class="headerlink" title="Precisely How To Play Roulette In Counter-Strike: Global Offensive"></a>Precisely How To Play Roulette In Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</h1><p>Roulette in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) is a game of chance that gives players the opportunity to win big. The basic premise of the game is to place bets on where you think the spinning roulette ball will end up after it falls off the wheel. If your prediction is correct, your bet will payout at a designated multiplier, which can be found below the betting board.</p>
<p>The following table lists all of the possible bet multipliers for each number:</p>
<p>Bet Multiplier Odds Red 1/12 2.083 Black 1/12 2.083 Green 1/12 2.083 Zero 1/36 10.000 1st 18/36 5.556 2nd 18/36 5.556 3rd 18/36 5.556 4th 9/36 11.111</p>
<p>To play roulette in CS:GO, follow these simple steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose the amount you would like to bet by clicking on one of the chip denominations located at the bottom of the screen. Roulette accepts two different currencies - Euros (€) and pounds (£). For this demonstration, we will use Euros (€). NOTE: Your current account balance will be displayed in the bottom left corner of the screen.</li>
</ol>
<p>2)Click on either red, black, green, or zero to place your bet. In this example, we’ll bet €5 on black by clicking on the black chip and then clicking on the number where we want to place our bet.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>A countdown timer will appear once you have placed your bet, giving you time to make additional bets or observe the game before it begins. Once time runs out, the ball will be released and begin spinning around the edge of the wheel.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>Watch as the ball eventually falls off of the wheel and lands in one of 37 numbered slots. If your bet matches where the ball ends up, your payout multiplier will be displayed above your original bet amount as well as added to your total balance!</li>
</ol>
