        <h1 id="Hawaii-Gambling-Laws-Unclear-–-What-is-Legal-and-What-is-Not"><a href="#Hawaii-Gambling-Laws-Unclear-–-What-is-Legal-and-What-is-Not" class="headerlink" title="Hawaii Gambling Laws Unclear – What is Legal and What is Not?"></a>Hawaii Gambling Laws Unclear – What is Legal and What is Not?</h1><p>Hawaii gambling laws are some of the most confusing in the country. This is because the state has a long history of gambling, dating back to the days of the Hawaiian monarchy. However, this history has also resulted in a lot of confusion about what is and is not legal.</p>
<p>One of the main sources of confusion is that Hawaii does not have a specific law that prohibits gambling. Instead, gambling is generally banned under the state’s criminal code. This code prohibits a wide range of activities, including but not limited to: betting, gambling, keeping a gaming table, and conducting lotteries.</p>
<p>However, there are some exceptions to this general rule. For example, social gambling is allowed as long as it does not involve any sort of profit or prize. And while horse racing is technically illegal in Hawaii, there are no laws that specifically prohibit it. In fact, there are several racetracks in the state that offer live racing and simulcast betting.</p>
<p>So what does all this mean for players in Hawaii? In short, it’s difficult to say. There have been cases where people have been prosecuted for gambling-related activities, so it’s definitely not advisable to take any chances. At the same time, however, there seems to be a fair amount of tolerated grey area when it comes to gambling in Hawaii.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to gamble in Hawaii, your best bet is probably to stick to the licensed racetracks. These facilities are heavily regulated and offer a relatively safe environment for players. You can also check with local authorities to see if there are any other legally sanctioned gambling options available in your area. Otherwise, it’s best to avoid any type of online or offline gambling activity altogether</p>
<h1 id="No-clarity-yet-on-who-polices-Hawaii-islands-gambling-laws"><a href="#No-clarity-yet-on-who-polices-Hawaii-islands-gambling-laws" class="headerlink" title="No clarity yet on who polices Hawaii islands gambling laws"></a>No clarity yet on who polices Hawaii islands gambling laws</h1><p>The legal status of gambling on the Hawaiian Islands is a little murky. While there are laws against some forms of gambling, there is no one agency specifically charged with enforcing them. This has led to a situation where different forms of gambling are legal in different places on the islands.</p>
<p>Gambling is prohibited by statute in the State of Hawaii, with a few exceptions. Section 712-1220 of the Revised Statutes of Hawaii makes it a misdemeanor to engage in nearly any form of gambling. This includes playing poker, bingo, or any other game for money or other valuable thing. The only exception is pari-mutuel wagering on horse and dog races.</p>
<p>So how is it that casino gambling is legal in some places on the islands and not others? The answer lies in the history of gambling regulation in Hawai’i. In 1961, the legislature enacted the island’s first gaming law, which legalized limited casino gambling on Oahu. At that time, the law enforcement responsibility for gaming was placed with the Honolulu Police Department (HPD).</p>
<p>In 1975, after concerns about organized crime were raised, the legislature created the Hawai’i Racing Commission (HRC) to regulate pari-mutuel wagering. The HRC was also given authority over casino gambling on Oahu. This division of responsibility remained in place until 2005, when the legislature transferred all regulatory authority for casino gambling to the HRC.</p>
<p>This change in jurisdiction led to a series of lawsuits between the HPD and HRC over which agency had jurisdiction over illegal casino operations. The courts eventually ruled that both agencies had concurrent jurisdiction over illegal casinos. This resulted in a “whack-a-mole” approach to shutting down casinos, with each agency taking down operations as they came to light.</p>
<p>In 2012, the legislature passed Act 204, which transferred regulatory authority for all forms of gambling other than pari-mutuel wagering from state agencies to counties. This effectively decentralized gambling regulation and gave each county authority to legalize and regulate specific forms of gambling within its borders. As a result, casino gambling is now legal in Honolulu but not Maui County, while bingo is legal in both places.</p>
<p>So who should you contact if you want to gamble on the Hawaiian islands? It depends on what type of gambling you are interested in! If you want to bet on horses or dogs, then contact the Hawai’i Racing Commission at (808) 586-3000 or visit their website at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www2.hiracingcommission.org/">http://www2.hiracingcommission.org/</a>. If you want to play poker or bingo for money, then check with your local county government to see if those activities are legal where you are staying.</p>
<h1 id="Island-gambling-still-a-murky-area"><a href="#Island-gambling-still-a-murky-area" class="headerlink" title="Island gambling still a murky area"></a>Island gambling still a murky area</h1><p>Island gambling is a murky area. The casinos are often tied to organized crime, and the casinos are always happy to take advantage of loopholes in the law.</p>
<p>There have been a number of investigations into casino activities on the islands, but most of these investigations have been shut down by corruption or lack of evidence. The few that have been successful have only resulted in minor fines for the casinos.</p>
<p>This has led to many people feeling that the casino industry is untouchable. This has also allowed the casinos to continue to prey on tourists and locals alike. They know that most people don’t want to cause a scene, so they can get away with lot of shady business.</p>
<p>Senator Michael Kaplowitz is trying to change all this. He has introduced a bill that would shut down all the casinos on the islands. This would go a long way towards cleaning up the industry and making it more fair for everyone involved.</p>
<p>It’s unclear whether this bill will pass, but it’s an important step in the right direction. The casino industry is notorious for its corruption and lack of transparency. It’s time for things to change, and Senator Kaplowitz is leading the charge.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-in-Hawaii-Who’s-policing-the-law"><a href="#Gambling-in-Hawaii-Who’s-policing-the-law" class="headerlink" title="Gambling in Hawaii: Who’s policing the law?"></a>Gambling in Hawaii: Who’s policing the law?</h1><p>Gambling in Hawaii is a popular pastime, especially among locals. With so many casinos and gambling venues available, it can be hard to know who’s responsible for ensuring that gambling is done lawfully. This article will explore the role of the Hawaii Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE) in regulating gambling in the state, as well as recent efforts by the DGE to crack down on illegal gambling operations.</p>
<p>The Hawaii Division of Gaming Enforcement is a division of the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs that is responsible for enforcing gambling laws in Hawaii. The DGE is charged with ensuring that all forms of gambling are conducted lawfully in the state, from casino games to lotteries to poker tournaments. In addition to investigating and prosecuting illegal gambling operations, the DGE also provides education and outreach to help Hawaiians understand their rights and responsibilities when it comes to gambling.</p>
<p>In recent years, the DGE has made a number of high-profile arrests for illegal gambling operations. In 2016, for example, the DGE raided an underground poker tournament that was taking place in a hotel room on Maui. The raid resulted in 15 arrests and the seizure of more than $200,000 in cash and casino chips.</p>
<p>More recently, in 2018, the DGE teamed up with local law enforcement agencies to raid a casino in Waianae that was allegedly being operated without a license. The raid resulted in the arrest of six people and the seizure of over $100,000 in cash and casino chips.</p>
<p>These raids underscore the importance of the DGE’s work in ensuring that gambling is conducted lawfully in Hawaii. By cracking down on illegal operations, the DGE helps protect Hawaiians from exploitation by criminals and helps ensure a safe and fair gaming environment for all residents and visitors to the state.</p>
<h1 id="The-legality-of-gambling-in-Hawaii-–-who-decides"><a href="#The-legality-of-gambling-in-Hawaii-–-who-decides" class="headerlink" title="The legality of gambling in Hawaii – who decides?"></a>The legality of gambling in Hawaii – who decides?</h1><p>There is much discussion around the legality of gambling in Hawaii. Specifically, who makes the final decision on whether or not gambling is legal in the state? This is an important question as it can have a big impact on how this industry operates in Hawaii.</p>
<p>The answer to this question is not simple. There are multiple layers of government involved in making these decisions, and there is no one definitive answer. It depends on the type of gambling activity and where it takes place.</p>
<p>First, it’s important to understand that Hawaii is a two-level state government system. There is the state government, which is headquartered in Honolulu and made up of elected officials. And then there are the county governments, which are divided into six counties: Kaua‘i, O‘ahu, Maui, Hawai‘i Island, Lana‘i, and Moloka‘i. Each county has its own elected officials who make decisions about local issues such as zoning and gambling.</p>
<p>So when it comes to gambling, different activities may be legal or illegal depending on which county you are in. For example, bingo games are legal in some counties but not others. This inconsistency can be confusing for residents and businesses operating in Hawaii.</p>
<p>In general, the state government has been more restrictive when it comes to gambling than the county governments. The state has enacted laws banning certain types of gambling (e.g., casino-style games), while the counties have allowed certain types of gambling (e.g., bingo).</p>
<p>But there have been some cases where the state has overruled a decision by a county government. For instance, in 2006 the state banned online gaming sites from operating in Hawai‘i, even though some counties had previously approved them. So it can be difficult to predict what will happen when it comes to gambling legality in Hawaii.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, it can be said that there is a lot of inconsistency when it comes to gambling law in Hawaii. This can be frustrating for residents and businesses trying to navigate this complex system. But at least we know that there is one thing that is for sure – the debate over gambling legality in Hawaii will continue!</p>
