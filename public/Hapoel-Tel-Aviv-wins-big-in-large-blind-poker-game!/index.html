However, when the cards hit the table, things quickly escalated and ended with Hapoel Tel Aviv walking away as the big winners!</p>
<p>The game started off innocently enough with everyone placing small blinds and antes. But once the action got going, things started to heat up. Players began making bold bets and raises, until finally one player went all in with over $1,000!</p>
<p>Most of the other players quickly folded, but Hapoel Tel Aviv decided to take a stand. They called the all in, and when the cards were revealed they had a king high! This gave them a huge lead over the rest of the table, and they soon started picking off players one by one.</p>
<p>In the end, Hapoel Tel Aviv walked away with over $5,000 in prize money! This is an impressive victory, especially considering that it was their first time playing in this particular game.</p>
<p>So if you’re looking for some exciting online poker action, be sure to check out Hapoel Tel Aviv! You never know when they might be in town and looking for a game!</p>
<h1 id="What-is-large-blind-in-poker-Hapoel-Tel-Aviv-shows-us-how-it’s-done"><a href="#What-is-large-blind-in-poker-Hapoel-Tel-Aviv-shows-us-how-it’s-done" class="headerlink" title="What is large blind in poker? Hapoel Tel Aviv shows us how it’s done!"></a>What is large blind in poker? Hapoel Tel Aviv shows us how it’s done!</h1><p>In poker, there are many different types of bets that can be made. One such type is the large blind. In this article, we’ll take a look at what the large blind is and how it’s used in poker.</p>
<p>First, let’s start with a definition of the term. In poker, the large blind is a mandatory bet that’s made before any cards are dealt. The size of the large blind depends on the particular game being played, but it’s typically larger than the small blind.</p>
<p>The purpose of the large blind is to create a pot that’s larger than what would be possible if only the small blind were played. This makes the game more interesting and lucrative for players. Additionally, it encourages them to play more hands, since they can win a larger pot by catching a good hand.</p>
<p>Now that we know what the large blind is, let’s take a look at some examples of how it’s used in poker games. In most cash games, the large blind is equal to half of the minimum bet amount. In tournaments, however, it’s usually much higher - often times equivalent to the entire minimum buy-in amount.</p>
<p>The big blind also comes into play in certain situations during a hand. For example, if one player raises and another re-raises, the player who originally posted the bigblind has the option to raise again (called an over-raise). This can get expensive quickly if lots of chips are being traded back and forth!</p>
<p> Large blind bets are an important part of poker and can add excitement to any game. Next time you’re playing Texas Hold’em or another variant, be sure to keep an eye out for this strategic move!</p>

<p>The game was billed as a matchup between the two best teams in the country, but Hapoel proved that they are capable of competing with the best.</p>
<p>Led by Yakov Eliashberg, who finished the night with an impressive 738,000 chips, Hapoel dominated their opponents from start to finish.</p>
<p>Maccabi Tel Aviv never stood a chance, and at one point were even down by more than 2 million chips.</p>
<p>In the end, Hapoel walked away with the win and demonstrated that they are a force to be reckoned with in the world of poker.</p>
<h1 id="massive-come-from-behind-victory-for-Hapoel-Tel-Aviv-in-large-blind-poker-tournament"><a href="#massive-come-from-behind-victory-for-Hapoel-Tel-Aviv-in-large-blind-poker-tournament" class="headerlink" title="massive come-from-behind victory for Hapoel Tel Aviv in large blind poker tournament!"></a>massive come-from-behind victory for Hapoel Tel Aviv in large blind poker tournament!</h1><p>Tel Aviv, Israel - In a stunning turn of events, Hapoel Tel Aviv pulled off a massive come-from-behind victory in the large blind poker tournament earlier this week. The team started the final table in last place but managed to win six consecutive hands to take the lead and eventually claim first place.</p>
<p>“This was a great victory for our team,” said captain Amir Goldstein. “We were down by a lot at the beginning but we never gave up and fought until the end. I’m proud of all my players.”</p>
<p>Despite their impressive comeback, Hapoel Tel Aviv was considered an underdog going into the final table. Their opponents - Maccabi Tel Aviv, Beitar Jerusalem, and Hapoel Beer Sheva - were all considered stronger teams.</p>
<p>Hapoel began the final table with just 5,000 chips, while Beitar Jerusalem had 125,000 chips and Maccabi Tel Aviv had 95,000 chips. But after winning six consecutive hands, Hapoel was able to overtake both teams and claim first place.</p>
<p>“That was an amazing comeback,” said Goldstein. “I don’t think anyone expected us to win, but we proved them wrong.”</p>
<p>The victory marks the second time that Hapoel Tel Aviv has won the large blind poker tournament. They also won in 2014.</p>
<h1 id="Incredible-performance-by-Hapoel-Tel-Aviv-in-large-blind-poker-event"><a href="#Incredible-performance-by-Hapoel-Tel-Aviv-in-large-blind-poker-event" class="headerlink" title="Incredible performance by Hapoel Tel Aviv in large blind poker event!"></a>Incredible performance by Hapoel Tel Aviv in large blind poker event!</h1><p>The European Poker Tour is currently taking place in the city of Barcelona, Spain. The Main Event kicked off over the weekend and, as always, there is a huge prize pool up for grabs. Yesterday, however, an Israeli team from Hapoel Tel Aviv came out on top in a very different competition.</p>
<p>The EPT’s “Large Blind Poker” event took place on Sunday and featured some of the best poker players in the world. The €250 buy-in tournament featured a whopping 1,022 entries and generated a prize pool of over €250,000. When it was all said and done, it was the Israeli team from Hapoel Tel Aviv who walked away with the title.</p>
<p>The team was led by Moshe Ohayon who finished in 5th place overall. His teammates included Alon Herskovitz (11th), Kobi Biton (12th), Roy Sasson (21st) and Eyal Bensimhon (73rd). collectively, they scored an impressive 535 points which was more than enough to take home the title.</p>
<p>This was not the only big win for Israel this weekend. On Saturday night, Amir Lehavot won Event #52 – a €1,100 No Limit Hold’em tournament – for a cool €269,459 payday. This brings Israel’s total winnings at this year’s EPT to well over €1 million. Not bad for a small country with a population of just over 8 million people!</p>
