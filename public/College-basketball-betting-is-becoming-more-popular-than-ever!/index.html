The excitement of the games and the potential to win big money is a huge draw for many people. If you’re interested in getting into college basketball betting, this article is for you!</p>
<p>In this article, we will discuss some of the basics of college basketball betting. We will cover how to bet on games, how to read odds, and some of the different types of bets that you can make. By the end of this article, you will be ready to start betting on college basketball games!</p>
<p>How to Bet on College Basketball Games</p>
<p>The first thing you need to know about betting on college basketball games is how to place your bets. There are a few different ways that you can place your bets:</p>
<p>Point Spread - This is the most common type of bet in college basketball. With a point spread bet, you wager on which team will win the game, but also by how many points they will win by. For example, if Team A is favored by 7 points over Team B, then a wager on Team A would win if they won by 8 or more points. A wager on Team B would only win if they won outright or lost by less than 7 points.</p>
<p>Moneyline - With a moneyline bet, you simply bet on which team will win the game. There is no point spread involved. The team that is favored will have a negative number next to their name (indicating how much money you have to wager in order to win $100), while the underdog will have a positive number next to their name (indicating how much money you would earn if you wagered $100).</p>
<p>Over/Under - This type of bet involves predicting whether the total points scored in a game will be over or under a certain number. You would typically see an Over/Under line set at around 160 points, for example. If you think that there will be more than 160 points scored in the game, then you would bet “over”. If you think that there will be fewer than 160 points scored, then you would bet “under”.</p>
<p>Now that we have covered how to place your bets, let’s take a look at how to read odds!</p>

How to beat the bookies when betting on college basketball games.4. College basketball odds: who is the favourite?"></a>Why sports activities betting is the new way to make money on college basketball games.3. How to beat the bookies when betting on college basketball games.4. College basketball odds: who is the favourite?</h1><p>Betting on sports activities is a great way to make some extra money, and NCAA basketball is no exception. In this article, we will go over why sports betting is the new way to make money on college basketball games, as well as how to beat the bookies when betting on these matchups. Finally, we will take a look at the college basketball odds for the upcoming season and see who is the favourite to win it all.</p>
<p>The great thing about sports betting is that there are so many different ways to make money off of it. You can bet on who will win or lose, how many points they will score, or how many turnovers they will commit. You can also bet on whether or not there will be a three-point shot made, or whether there will be a lead change in the second half. The options are endless, which means that you can find a bet that suits your needs perfectly.</p>
<p>Furthermore, sports betting offers some of the best odds in the casino world. For example, if you were to bet $100 on a team to win outright, your odds would be around -180. This means that you would have to risk $180 in order to win $100. While this may not seem like a great deal at first glance, it is actually quite good when compared to other casino games. For instance, the odds for blackjack are around -240, which means that you would have to risk $240 in order to win just $100.</p>
<p>So why should you bet on college basketball? There are a few reasons that stand out from the rest. First and foremost, college basketball is an exciting sport with lots of high-scoring games and tight contests. This makes it perfect for betting purposes, as there are always lots of opportunities to make money. Secondly, the popularity of college basketball continues to grow each and every year. This means that more people are getting involved in the betting action, which leads to even better odds for those who know what they are doing. Finally, the spreads and lines offered by online sportsbooks tend to be much more favourable than those found at brick-and-mortar casinos. This gives players plenty of incentive to place their bets online rather than in person.</p>
<p>Now that we have covered some of the basics behind sports betting, let’s take a look at how you can beat the bookies when wagering on college basketball games. The first thing that you need to do is familiarize yourself with the different types of bets that are available. This includes understanding what each bet entails as well as how much money you can expect to win (or lose) if your prediction turns out to be correct. Once you have a solid understanding of all of the different bets available, you can start making informed decisions about which ones offer the best value for your money .</p>
<p>Another important thing to keep in mind when betting on college basketball is variance . In simple terms, variance refers to how often your bets come up winners or losers . A low variance game means that your bets are likely going to come up winners more often than they lose , while high variance games mean that your bets will be won and lost more evenly . When wagering on college basketball , it is important to seek out high variance games since they offer the potential for greater payouts .</p>
<p>Finally , don’t forget about situational betting . Just like any other sport , college basketball has its fair share of upsets and surprises . When placing situational bets , it is important go beyond simply picking who will win or lose . Instead , try looking at specific factors such as home court advantage , injuries , coaching changes , etc . By doing your homework and taking all relevant factors into account , you may just find yourself cashing in on an unexpected upset !</p>
<p>Now that we have gone over some basic tips for winning when betting on college basketball games , let’s take a look at who is currently favoured by oddsmakers heading into the 2017-2018 season . According To ESPN’s Basketball Power Index (BPI), Villanova University tops their list as favourites with Duke University close behind them at number two . Gonzaga University rounds out ESPN’s top three while perennial powerhouse University of Kentucky falls just outside of their top ten rankings coming in at eleventh place overall ..</p>

Sports activities betting 101: everything you need to know about betting on college basketball"></a>5. Sports activities betting 101: everything you need to know about betting on college basketball</h1><p>It’s the time of year that basketball enthusiasts everywhere are glued to their TVs and computer screens, watching the NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball Tournament. If you’re new to sports activities betting - or just basketball betting - you’re in for a treat.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll go over what you need to know before placing your bets on any of the 63 games in the tournament.</p>
<p>Types of Bets</p>
<p>The first thing you need to understand is the different types of bets that can be placed on college basketball. The most common are moneyline bets, where you simply bet on who will win the game, and spread bets, where you bet on whether the team will cover the point spread. There are also futures bets, which involve betting on who will win the tournament or a specific game months in advance, as well as proposition (prop) bets, which are exotic wagers on things like how many points a particular player will score.</p>
<p>Moneyline Bets</p>
<p>The simplest type of bet is the moneyline bet, where you simply bet on who will win the game. The odds vary depending on which team is favored, but typically the favourite will have shorter odds and pay out less if they win than the underdog. For example, if Duke is playing North Carolina State and Duke is favored by 10 points, then a $10 bet on Duke would payout $15 if they won ($25 minus the $10 stake). A $10 bet on North Carolina State would pay out $26 if they upset Duke (the $10 stake plus $16 profit).</p>
<p>Spread Bets</p>
<p>Spread betting is a bit more complex than moneyline betting, but it’s still relatively straightforward. In a spread bet, you bet not only on who will win but also whether they will cover the point spread. The point spread is a number chosen by bookmakers that reflects their opinion on how likely it is that one team will beat another. As an example, let’s say Syracuse is playing Butler in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. Syracuse may be favored by 7 points in this matchup. This means that if you place a spread bet on Syracuse, they would have to win by more than 7 points for you to make a profit; if they only won by 6 points or fewer, your bet would lose even though Syracuse technically won the game. Conversely, Butler would have to lose by fewer than 7 points for you to make a profit (or win outright if they were underdog), and so forth.</p>
<p> Futures Bets</p>
<p>Futures bets are just what they sound like - wagers placed months in advance on things like who will win the NCAA Tournament or individual games within it. These bets offer some of the best value for recreational gamblers since there’s no immediate pressure to make accurate predictions - after all, even knowledgeable sports fans can’t predict every upset! However, be aware that bookmakers typically offer worse odds when it comes to futures bets as compared to other types of wagers; this is because they have better information about who is likely to win and don’t want people making easy profits by correctly predicting long-shot outcomes. For instance, at time of writing William Hill was offering odds of 250/1 for anyone who wanted to wager £1 that Gonzaga would win this year’s tournament - essentially meaning that £250 could be turned into £25000 if Gonzaga pulled off an unprecedented victory. However, most other teams had odds ranging from 6/1 to 20/1, making them much more likely propositions from a gambling perspective.</p>
