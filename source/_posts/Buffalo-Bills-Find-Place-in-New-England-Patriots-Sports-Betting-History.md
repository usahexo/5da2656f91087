Buffalo Bills Find Place in New England Patriots Sports Betting History

The NFL’s Buffalo Bills have had their ups and downs over the years, but as of late they have been a breeding ground for sports betting investment opportunities. The Patriots have been the dominate team in the AFC East for almost two decades now, leaving the Bills to scrap for anything they can get. However, during the 2017 season there were some signs that the Bills may be turning a corner. They started out 5-2, with their only losses coming against the Patriots and Carolina Panthers. This put them in a good position to make a run at the playoffs, but they ultimately finished 6-10 and missed out on postseason contention.

Despite their losing record, there were still some interesting moments from the Bills’ 2017 season that could pay off for sports bettors this year. One of those moments came in week 13 when they went into New England and pulled off a 23-3 upset victory over the Patriots. This was by far their biggest win of the season and it was made even more impressive by the fact that it came on the road against one of the best teams in the league.

One thing that we’ve learned about Rex Ryan is that he loves to give his opponents bulletin board material, and he definitely didn’t hold back before this game. In fact, he said that he wanted to “kick New England’s ass” and that his team was “coming to Foxborough to beat Tom Brady”. This type of trash talk is usually just bravado from Ryan, but it will be interesting to see if he tries to ratchet things up even more heading into this year’s matchup with New England.

If you’re looking for an edge when betting on this game, then keeping an eye on Ryan’s pregame antics could be a good place to start. He has never been one to shy away from controversy and he will definitely be trying to get inside of Tom Brady’s head leading up to this game. The Bills are obviously huge underdogs in this matchup, but there is definitely potential for an upset if Ryan can get his team fired up.

In what can only be called a shocking upset, the Buffalo Bills managed to take down the heavily favored New England Patriots this past Sunday. For those who wagered on the Bills in this game, it was an incredibly sweet victory, as sports betting odds had New England pegged as a heavy favorite.

How did the Bills manage to pull off this fantastic upset? To begin with, they played an excellent game defensively, holding the Patriots offense largely in check. In addition, Buffalo was able to capitalize on a few key turnovers by New England, including one that resulted in a touchdown.

All in all, it was a fantastic team effort by the Bills, and one that is sure to go down in history as one of their most impressive victories.

#  Buffalo Bills are the Surprise of Week 1 - Proving Vegas Wrong and Winning at New England Patriots Sports Betting

After a tumultuous offseason which included the departure of their star running back, many experts were not giving the Buffalo Bills much of a chance in their Week 1 matchup against the New England Patriots. In fact, the Bills were listed as 16-point underdogs at some sportsbooks. However, Buffalo shocked the NFL world by coming away with a 21-12 victory on the road.

One of the main reasons for Buffalo's upset win was the play of their defense. The Bills held Tom Brady and the Patriots offense to just 12 points, while forcing two turnovers. This included a strip sack by Jerry Hughes that led to a touchdown for Buffalo.

In addition to the defensive effort, quarterback Josh Allen also played well for Buffalo. Allen completed 15 of 22 passes for 196 yards and a touchdown, while also rushing for 39 yards on nine carries.

The Bills will look to build off of this impressive win when they host the Los Angeles Chargers in Week 2.
