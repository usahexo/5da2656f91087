# Dazzling Bingo Maldives: What to Have on Your Play List

Gone are the days when bingo was only played in smoky, windowless basements or church halls- Maldives beckons you to try this exciting game in dazzling surroundings with incredible marine life as your backdrop!

The best part is that there is no great expertise required- even first timers can feel confident they will enjoy themselves. Here is what you need to know to get started:

-There are different types of bingo games- the most common ones being 75 ball and 90 ball. However, there are many variants such as Swedish bingo and blackout bingo, so ask the locals or your cruise director what variation is being played before purchasing your cards.

-A standard bingo card contains 25 squares arranged in 5 rows of 5. Numbers range between 1 and 75 for 75 ball bingo or 1 and 90 for 90 ball bingo.

-In order to win, players must daub (mark) off numbers on their cards as they are called out by the caller. The first player to achieve a line (vertical, horizontal or diagonal), full house (all squares marked off) or other designated pattern will shout “BINGO” and claim victory!

Now that you know the basics, it’s time to decide what to bring with you on your play list:

1) Appropriate clothing for the climate- it can be hot, sticky and humid during the day in Maldives, so light clothing that allows sweat to evaporate is a good idea. It cools down considerably at night though, so pack a cardigan or light jacket too.

2) Sunscreen, sunglasses and hats- these are essential items any time you are in the sun, but especially when enjoying outdoor activities such as playing bingo. A good tip is to bring a sunscreen that also offers mosquito protection- nothing ruins a fun day like getting eaten alive by pesky mosquitos!

3) Insect repellent- see above! Mosquitos can really put a damper on things, so be sure to come prepared with some good insect repellent. citronella based repellents work well if you don’t mind smelling like lemons.

4) Something to drink and snack on- dehydration can quickly set in during those hot, sticky days in Maldives, so make sure you have plenty of water (or other drinks) with you at all times. As for snacks, anything that is easy to carry and doesn’t spoil quickly is a good choice such as fruits, nuts or trail mix. Sandwiches and small cakes also travel well and make for a tasty snack later on.

# Bingo Buffet: Choosing the Best Menu Items for Maldives Fun

If you're looking for a bit of fun in the sun, consider heading to the Maldives for some bingo and buffet action. The resorts here offer some of the best all-inclusive dining experiences in the world, with a seemingly endless variety of foods to choose from. So, what are the best items to look out for on the buffet menu?

Well, it really depends on your preferences. If you're a fan of seafood, then you'll be in for a real treat – Maldives buffets usually have a fantastic selection of fish and shellfish on offer. If you're not so keen on seafood, then there's plenty of other delicious cuisine to choose from, including Indian, Thai and Italian fare.

# Bingo in Paradise: What to Pack for Your Trip

Thinking about your upcoming bingo trip to the Caribbean? Don't forget to pack these essentials!

Sunscreen: The tropics are known for their intense sun, so be sure to protect yourself with a good sunscreen.

Bug spray: There's nothing worse than being eaten alive by mosquitoes while trying to enjoy a game of bingo. Make sure you bring along some bug spray to keep the bugs at bay.

Sunhat: A sunhat is not only essential for keeping you cool, but it also helps protect your skin from the sun's rays.

Sunglasses: Protect your eyes from the bright sun with a good pair of sunglasses.

Swimsuit: You'll definitely want to bring your swimsuit so you can take a dip in the ocean or pool.

Beach towel: A beach towel is perfect for drying off after a swim or using as a blanket on the sand.

Shoes: Be sure to pack a pair of shoes that can get wet - like sandals or water shoes - as you'll likely be spending plenty of time by the water.

Lightweight clothes: When packing for your bingo trip, aim to take lightweight clothes that will keep you cool in the tropical weather. Shorts, tank tops and other light fabrics are ideal.
