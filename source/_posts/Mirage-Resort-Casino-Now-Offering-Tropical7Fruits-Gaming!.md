#  Experience The Mirage Resort Casino's New Tropical7Fruits Game!

The Mirage Resort Casino is one of the most popular destinations on the Las Vegas Strip. Guests can enjoy a variety of casino games, live entertainment and dining options. This summer, the Mirage has added a new game to its casino floor - Tropical7Fruits.

Tropical7Fruits is a simple but fun game that simulates a fruit machine. Players can choose to bet 1, 3 or 5 credits on each spin and can win up to 100 credits. The game consists of 7 reels, with each reel containing 6 symbols. There are 4 different types of symbols: fruits (cherries, lemons, oranges and pineapples), bells, stars and bars.

Each time one of the three bells symbols appears on the reels, the player wins 5 credits. When three stars appear anywhere on the reels, the player wins 10 credits. If three bar symbols appear anywhere on the reels, the player wins 25 credits. And when three fruit symbols appear anywhere on the reels, the player wins 100 credits.

A bonus round is triggered when three or more pineapple symbols appear anywhere on the reels. In this round, players can choose from either a blue or red prize. The blue prize is always worth more than the red prize, but there is only a 50/50 chance of winning it. If players correctly choose the blue prize, they will double their total bet amount; if they choose incorrectly, they lose their entire bet amount.

Tropical7Fruits is a fun game that offers plenty of excitement and potential payouts. Whether you're looking for an easy way to pass some time or you're looking for a new casino game to try your luck at, Tropical7Fruits is definitely worth checking out!
