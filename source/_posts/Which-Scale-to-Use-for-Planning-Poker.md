#  Which Scale to Use for Planning Poker?

The planning poker card game is a great way to estimate the effort required for software development tasks. However, you may be wondering which scale to use when playing the game.

There are three primary scales that can be used: story points, relative estimation, and t-shirt sizes.

The most popular scale for planning poker is story points. This scale assigns point values to different tasks, which can then be used to estimate the effort required for completing them.

Another option is relative estimation. This scale uses terms such as "small," "medium," and "large" to describe the effort required for completing tasks. It doesn't assign point values like story points, but it can be easier to use than the story point scale because everyone understands the sizing terminology.

The t-shirt size scale is another option that can be used for planning poker. This scale assigns different shirt sizes (such as small, medium, and large) to different task effort levels.

#  Loescher's Planning Poker Scale

The Loescher Planning Poker Scale is a tool used to estimate the time required to complete a project. It is a scale from 1 (very short) to 10 (very long), with 5 being average.

To use the scale, first estimate how long the project will take. Then, assign a number to that estimate on the scale. For example, if you think the project will take 5 days, then assign a 5 to that estimate.

Next, assign numbers to each task in the project and add them up. This gives you an estimate for the whole project. You can then use the Loescher Planning Poker Scale to break that estimate down into smaller tasks that can be completed in order to reach the goal.

#  What Scale Does Loescher Use for Planning Poker?

In the book "The Art of Possibility," Benjamin Zander brilliantly illuminates the power of goals. He points out that if you want to achieve a big goal, you break it down into a series of small goals. Each time you achieve the small goal, you get closer to your big goal.

Loescher, an education expert, applies this philosophy to curriculum planning. Before using poker to determine curriculum goals, Loescher and his team use a smaller planning scale. This smaller scale is designed to help them identify what students know and can do at various points in their schooling.

The smaller scale also helps educators identify what specific knowledge and skills they need to teach in order for students to be able to reach the objectives on the larger scale. Finally, this approach ensures that there is adequate time for educators to plan and sequence instruction so that students can meet the larger learning goals.

#  The Loescher Planning Poker Scale

The Loescher Planning Poker Scale is a tool used to estimate the time required to complete a project. The scale ranges from 1 (very short time) to 10 (very long time).

The scale can be used in two ways. First, it can be used to estimate the time required for a specific task. Second, it can be used to estimate the time required for a project as a whole.

To use the scale to estimate the time required for a specific task, first determine the number of points that correspond to the amount of time you think the task will take. Then, using the Loescher Planning Poker Scale, assign a point value to each task.

For example, if you think a task will take 2 hours, then you would assign 2 points to that task. If you think a task will take 5 days, then you would assign 5 points to that task.

Once you have assigned point values to all of the tasks, add up the points for each task and divide by the total number of points to get an average estimated time.

To use the scale to estimate the time required for a project as a whole, first determine the number of points that correspond to the amount of time you think the project will take. Then, using the Loescher Planning Poker Scale, assign a point value to each project phase.

For example, if you think a project will take 6 months, then you would assign 60 points to that project. If you think each phase of the project will take 1 month, then you would assign 10 points to each phase.

Once you have assigned point values to all of the phases, add up the points for each phase and divide by the total number of points to get an average estimated time.

#  Loescher's Scale for Planning Poker

The Loescher's Scale for Planning Poker is a valuable tool for estimating the effort required to complete a project. It is named after Italian Professor Gianluca Loescher, who developed the scale in the early 1990s.

The scale assigns point values to nine different task categories, with the most complex tasks worth the most points. The total number of points assigned to a project can be used to estimate how many hours will be needed to complete it.

A version of the scale that is commonly used in software development projects is shown below:


Task Points
Very easy 1-3
Easy 4-6
Medium 7-9
Hard 10-15
Very hard 16 or more


The scale can be adapted to other types of projects by modifying the point values assigned to task categories.

The use of the Loescher's Scale for Planning Poker can help avoid over- or under-estimating the effort required to complete a project. It can also help identify which tasks are most complex and should be given priority during project planning.
