#  What was the Ravens' original name?

The Baltimore Ravens were originally named the Cleveland Browns. Art Modell, the owner of the Browns, moved the team to Baltimore in 1996. Due to NFL rules, he was forced to leave the Browns' name, colors, and history behind in Cleveland.

#  What division do the Ravens play in?

John Harbaugh is the head coach of the Baltimore Ravens. He is in his tenth season as head coach, and has led the Ravens to six playoff appearances and a Super Bowl victory.

#  Who is the Ravens' quarterback?

There is no clear answer to this question, as the Ravens currently have three quarterbacks on their roster: Joe Flacco, Ryan Mallett, and Dustin Vaughan.

Flacco, the former Super Bowl MVP, has been the starter for the Ravens since they drafted him in 2008. However, he has been sidelined with a back injury since November and is not expected to return to the field this season.

Mallett was signed by the Ravens in November as a backup to Flacco. He has played in six games this season, starting one.

Vaughan was signed by the Ravens as an undrafted free agent in May 2016. He has not played in any games this season.

#  How many Super Bowl Championships have the Ravens won?

The Ravens are a professional American football team based in Baltimore, Maryland. The Ravens compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the American Football Conference (AFC) North division.

The team was established in 1996, and played its first season in 1997. The Ravens are coached by John Harbaugh and play their home games at M&T Bank Stadium.

The Ravens have won two Super Bowl championships (Super Bowl XXXV and Super Bowl XLVII), and six AFC North division championships. They are currently one of only four teams in NFL history to have never played in a conference championship game.
