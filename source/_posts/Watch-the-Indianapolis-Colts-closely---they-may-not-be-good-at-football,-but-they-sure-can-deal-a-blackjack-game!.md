# How To Deal Black Jack

When it comes to dealing black jack, there are a few basic steps that you need to follow in order to ensure a smooth game for all players. Here’s a quick overview:

1) Shuffle the cards thoroughly before starting the game. This ensures that all cards are randomly distributed and that no player has an advantage over any other.

2) Deal two cards face up to each player, and two cards face down to the dealer. The face up card is essentially the player’s “opening hand”.

3) Based on the first two cards drawn by each player, they must decide whether or not they want to hit (draw another card). If they choose not to hit, their turn ends and their total is tallied based on the value of their two cards.

4) If a player hits and draws a card with a value of 10 or higher, they must reveal their hand and compare totals with the dealer. If their total is higher than the dealer’s total (without going over 21), they win immediately! If their total is lower than or equal to the dealer’s total, they lose automatically.

5) If a player busts (goes over 21), they automatically lose regardless of what the dealer’s total is.

6) After all players have either hit or stood (based on their initial two-card hand), dealers must then turn over their face down card. The value of this card becomes the dealers “second card”. Players now have another opportunity to hit or stand based on this new information.

7) Once all players have completed their turns, dealers must then compare their final totals in order to determine winners and losers.
