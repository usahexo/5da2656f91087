# Blackjack: What are Cards Worth? Insights from Simenon

Georges Simenon was a Belgian writer known for his detective novels featuring the character Inspector Maigret. Although he was not a professional blackjack player, his analytical mind can shed light on the value of cards in the game of blackjack. In this article, we will explore the value of cards in blackjack as explained by Simenon.

## Understanding the Basics of Blackjack

Before discussing the value of cards in blackjack, it is important to understand the basics of the game. Blackjack is a card game that is played with one or more decks of standard playing cards. The objective of the game is to have a hand value closer to 21 than the dealer's hand value without going over 21. Players win their bets if their hand is higher than the dealer's hand or if the dealer busts.

## The Value of Cards in Blackjack

In blackjack, the cards are worth the following:

- Number cards (2-10): The value of number cards is equal to their face value. For example, a 5 of clubs is worth 5 points.
- Face cards (jack, queen, king): Face cards are worth 10 points each.
- Ace: The value of an ace can be either 1 or 11, depending on which value is more advantageous to the player.

According to Simenon, understanding the value of cards in blackjack is crucial for making strategic decisions at the table. Players must constantly calculate the value of their hand and determine whether to hit (take another card), stand (keep their current hand), or double down (double their bet and take one more card).

## Conclusion

Knowing the value of cards in blackjack is an important part of mastering the game. By following insights from Simenon and learning about the value of number cards, face cards, and aces, you can make more informed decisions and feel more confident at the table. However, it is important to remember that gambling can be addictive and should be approached responsibly. With insights from Simenon, you can take your blackjack skills to the next level and become a more successful and knowledgeable player.
